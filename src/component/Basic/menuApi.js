      "Maggi came into my life when I was eleven. In a cracker of a soft launch, Nestle silently distributed Maggi in schools. I ran back home with the yellow packet, concerned about how much of the two-minute wonder I would get to savour, since I would have to share it with my brother and sister. To my great joy — and to my siblings’ — we discovered that all of us had got a packet of Maggi each from school. Stupid of me to have thought only my class got the snack that promised a lip-smacking time. :- Arun Ram",

        "Driving home from work today I found myself daydreaming about cake. Something I often do. Food obsessed much? Anyways I started dreaming of strawberries. I bought a large pack of strawberries from Costco the other day and the strawberries are so good! When I grew up we always had strawberries. My mom would cut them up and sprinkle a little sugar on top and store them in the fridge. I often found myself searching for the strawberry with the most sugar granules on. I know, I know, strawberries are sweet on there on but you all must know by now I have a strange addiction to sugar!",

        "Hi. I love pizza. It’s no secret I love pizza. Last summer around this time, I wrote one of my first “Items of the Day” here on HelloGiggles about Ellio’s Pizza and how it is so weird and square-shaped and delicious. And then later last year, I wrote an Open Letter to Pizza in which I proclaimed I was willing to end up in jail, wrongly accused for murder, if only to get pizza for my last meal. That doesn’t make any sense but I just want you to understand that I love pizza so much that not only would I go to prison for pizza but I would be more than happy to devote well over half my time on the Internet talking about pizza. I mean, if the internet isn’t best used for talking about pizza, ordering pizza, learning new pizza recipes, making gifs of pizza, discussing the philosophies of various pizza crusts and toppings, pictures of cats and pizza together and telling people how much you love pizza, then what good is the internet? Which is why I feel it is my duty to return to my favorite topic before we here at HelloGiggles have spent too much time not discussing it. So I am going to tell you a little bit about my love affair with pizza. (Are you excited? I’m excited! I can’t even tell you guys how long I’ve wanted a forum to wax poetic about the virtues of pizza! Thank God this website exists! I’m serious! I almost wish it was called PizzaGiggles.com! WAIT, that is a great idea! I am totally going to do that!) - Annie Stamell  ",

Meeting them meant backbreaking work around the clock for textile mill workers in the island city of Mumbai. So much so, they hardly had time to feed themselves.",
